# A D&D Initiative tracker

### I developed this 'app' to make tracking initiative easy

I am a DM and frontend developer. I wanted a project to up my Javascript ES6 skills. And this is the result. Also, some of the players were counting the rolls of a random encounter. They knew by the sound of the dice there was an extra Goblin somewhere.

### Initiative tracker

In the middle of the screen you select the kind of character you want to add to the initiative. Fill in the form (even the health of a Player Character) and click add.

You characters will appear in the initiative list. You can go to the next of previous turns by clicking on the arrow buttons. Next turn ( ) is on the right side of the list, previous turn ( ) on the left. On the left top you see the round counter. This counter will be reset when you add a character. Clear the list by clicking on the X at the top of the list.

You can track the HP of a character by clicking on the heart symbol of the character. Fill in amount and click on to deal damage of click on to heal a character

### Dice roller

On the right you can roll dice. Click on the dice icon to roll 1 die. Or put your amount of dice on the line in front of the dice and click the dice icon.

### Some heads up

This app is made for modern browsers and for desktop.

### Future plans:

Plans to make this even better.

*   Make app mobile friendly
*   Dice accents for critcal hit or crit fail
*   Save your PC's
*   Animations for clearer initiative order
*   [suggestions?](github.com "Make a suggestion")

### Cookies:

I don't have any need to store any kind of information, cookies or other stuff. But to be honest: I use a Google font and I am not sure if they can track you on this site.

### Install locally

```
yarn install
yarn start
```
